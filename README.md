# Primo Usability Studies

## UX & Tweaks to the Primo Interface: Show & Tell Exchange – Angela Walker, Christina Dicarro, Sharon Clapp \(Connecticut State Colleges & Universities\)

### Ex Libris Northeast Users Group \(ENUG\) 

### Thursday, October 24, 2019 - New Paltz, NY 

#### 11:45 - 12:30 pm \(Breakout session \#2  - 45min\) 

Let’s share what we’ve learned from the usability tests conducted on our libraries’ respective Primo interfaces and talk about the “tweaks” that we’ve added to improve our systems. Connecticut State University librarians Angela Walker, Christina Dicarro, and Sharon Clapp will lead a robust “show and tell” exchange about Primo usability. This team organized and executed a consortium-wide usability testing project at multiple Connecticut State College & University locations and have presented about it in the past “sage on the stage” style \(see: https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1L5\_PYMCsNG5i77k\_PrYkjs2USIE1gQ9OMy0MUVNIgrc/edit?usp=sharing\). They think that ENUG is the perfect place to tap into the wisdom of their colleagues from other Ex Libris libraries. They’ll lead the session with a summary of their experiences, then it’s your turn. Bring stories of your own library’s usability tests \(website and/or discovery tool\) and Primo tweaks. We can talk about the good, the bad, and the ugly. This is the perfect time to get feedback on whatever Primo user experience ideas you have. Bring along your screenshots, prototypes, spreadsheets, github repos, questions for your colleagues or just war stories and crazy pie-in-the-sky if-only-Primo-could ideas… We will make our findings and solutions available on Github.
