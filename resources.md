* Primo Usability Guidelines and Test Script \(Primo New UI, not VE\) \[June 30, 2019\] [https://knowledge.exlibrisgroup.com/Primo/Product\_Documentation/Primo/New\_Primo\_User\_Interface/Primo\_Usability\_Guidelines\_and\_Test\_Script](https://knowledge.exlibrisgroup.com/Primo/Product_Documentation/Primo/New_Primo_User_Interface/Primo_Usability_Guidelines_and_Test_Script)
  * The summary of how to conduct usability testing:
    * Make a list of target test groups, recruit at least 3 usability testers from each group, once you have repeated results / are not learning anything new, then stop recruitment
    * Create list of tasks to be tested \(this documentation offers examples\) around user goals \(what do they come to Primo to do?\)
      * Add tasks that include any features that you have customized \(even if they are not common tasks\).
      * If you have any concerns that something on the site is not working, make sure to include it in your test.
      * The tasks should be written to avoid using the same labels that are used on the screen, to avoid leading participants.
    * Test out the sequence of tasks to make sure that one task doesn't bias the outcome of another. 
    * Once you have a list of tasks/question ready, go over each task/question and do/answer it yourself to make sure that each task works.
    * Run a pilot study: before running your test with all of your participants, just run it with one participant to confirm everything works and participants are not confused by the tasks. 
  * Create & use test script for test provider to give to tester \(sample provided in this documentation\)

  * "From this study, we learned that users had little difficulty using basic and advanced search, signing into and out of primo, and navigating their account. In other areas, where the difference between the two interfaces was more pronounced, study participants experienced more difficulty. Finally, we present customizations implemented at Washington State University to the design of the interface to help alleviate the observed issues."
